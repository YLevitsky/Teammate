# Teammate
An app for helping people find each other to collaborate.

Project Proposal: Teammate App
Teammate (name to be revised) is a stand-alone project (not derived from a pre-existing open-source project) seeking to connect people who are looking to contribute to local non-professional and semi-professional creative projects.
Teammate is not intended to be a hiring app; the purpose of the app is to facilitate connections in accordance to the following scenarios:
Alice is a director who wants to make a short comedy sketch, but needs two actors, in addition to her roommate, who will also be acting. Of the two actors she is looking for, one needs to be local, so that they can perform a dinner scene with Alice’s roommate, while the second actor only needs to skype in.
Bridget is an actress who is looking to build her portfolio, and lives in the same part of the city as Alice does. They do not know each other, but the gig Alice is offering would be perfect for Bridget.
Chris doesn’t want a professional acting career, but he does want to pursue acting as a hobby, and there are no local opportunities he is aware of. He lives across the country from Alice, and he’s got a good-enough webcam to fulfill Alice’s needs.
All three of these people would have a relatively hard time finding each other; at the very least, it would be an inconvenient process.
Teammate seeks to operate on similar principles to a dating app: proximity-based listings formatted as “I am a _____ seeking a _____" (for example, “I am a director seeking an actor” or “I am an independent videogame developer seeking a beta-tester”) and “I am a _____ who wants to participate in a _____" (i,e. “I am a drummer who wants to participate in a pop punk band” or “I am a make-up who wants to participate in making a film”).
This app is intended for use by people who are seeking to work on projects that are small-scale; Lionsgate Studios, EA Games and The Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra should not be using this app. Rather, the purpose is to connect people who want to make something together, but lack the resources to find other individuals with compatible goals.                                                                                    
Link to Educational Goals
This project aligns with the following educational goals (text taken from Project Introduction Slides):
•	Provide practical experience in using modern software development tools to perform the following tasks and
•	Project Management 
•	Version Control 
•	Build 
•	Test 
•	Issue Tracking  
•	As well as working in small teams.

This project will be complex, will consist of multiple components (constituting multiple codelines), and will require extensive testing and debugging. In other words, this project will provide students with an opportunity to engage in many of the standard processes of modern app development, preparing them for the sort of software development challenges they may expect to encounter in the real world.

Proposed Contribution 

Because this is a proposal for an original project, there exists no code base to which I can propose a specific contribution, and, not yet having a team, I would not want to claim an overly-specific role ahead of time. However, I would be interested in performing back-end development on this project, specifically in developing the match-making system; this app is intended to be somewhat analogous to a dating app, except that its “I am a _____ seeking a _____” options would be significantly more complex.
